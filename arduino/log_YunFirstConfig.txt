Hi! Nice to see you!
I'm your YunShield assistant sketch
I'll help you configuring your Yun in a matter of minutes
Let's start by communicating with the Linux processor
When LED (L13) will light up we'll be ready to go!
Waiting...
(in the meanwhile, if you are using the IDE's serial monitor, make sure that it's configured to send a "Newline")

Oops, it seems that you have no WiFi network available
Let's configure it manually
SSID of the network you want to connect to: 
ENSAAMA
Password for the network you want to connect to: 
**********
Encryption (eg WPA, WPA2, WEP): WPA2
We are almost done! Give a name and a password to your Yun
Name: Arduino3
Password: ********
One last question: where do you live?
Insert a two letters county code (eg IT, US, DE): FR
Waiting for the Yun to connect to the network.

Great! You can now reach your Yun from a browser typing http://192.168.240.1
Press 'Enter' key twice to start a serial terminal
